1. collect charge uptimes to stations
2. sort charge times -- get min and max during this -- min and max may be in the same charger uptime
3. 'merge' uptimes 
    cases:
    if they both have the same start time, erase the one with the lower end time-- with how I am sorting them, i can always delete the first of two when comparing
    else if they over lap, take the lower 0-index and higher 1-index

    POTENTIAL PROBLEM: deleting an element of a slice just 'zeroes it out'.  Does it also move them to the end of the slice? or will i have to check each element after to find the true gaps?
    It turns out it WAS deleting the entries in the slice, but the size and capacity of the original slice were not affected because I was using the reference of the station, but a copy of the slice

4. find gaps and accumulate them
5. max - min - gaps = total uptime
6. percent uptime = total uptime/max-min

7. What if there are downtime reads outside the uptime bounds? do we count that as part of the total time?
